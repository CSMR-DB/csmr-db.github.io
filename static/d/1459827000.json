This project was built using MeteorJS, React (with styled-components), D3.js, GraphQL and the database of choice was MongoDB. It was deployed locally on an Ubuntu Server VM and had a C# application to collect the data running on a Windows Server VM. There is nothing to show for it, since it was an internal project.
