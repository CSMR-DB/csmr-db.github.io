Full disclosure: I was also diagnosed with high-functioning autism relatively late, at age 18. This is not a huge deal, but I've decided to be completely up front with it.

Typical spaghetti code from an inexperienced individual. NO "architecture" whatsoever. Not surprising, obviously. In the following years I would get myself introduced to working with React, MeteorJS and a little bit of Vue. I even did some stuff with Wordpress & PHP, developing some templates for projects that required a website. In all these efforts, I was on my own. And every single time I realized I loved the feeling of trying to figure stuff out. I learned to have a love / hate relationship with being stuck with a problem because I would eventually find a solution.

I signed up for another half year of trying to figure things out myself, as I was warned that JavaScript / NodeJS / React was not part of their tech stack. I was tasked with building a metrics dashboard, to visualize the BHAG (Big, Hairy, Audacious Goal) as well as some other metrics. I built that project using MeteorJS, as it allowed me to get up & running quickly, together with React, Styled-Components and GraphQL. I was also responsible for deploying this app to a local environment, as well as a local MongoDB instance. A colleague built a C# metrics collector app, to get me the data I needed. Overall, I had an amazing time there.

I enjoyed working with Illustrator, After Effects, InDesign and even a bit of Cinema4D, and I\'d consider myself adequate on these fronts. What this means, however, is that I am able to communicate and collaborate with all these "different people". I am also a perfectionist and there is not a day that goes by where I don\'t find something that frustrates me. I absolutely LOVE good UX, and I hate seeing what could be considered "minor" flaws in design. The same applies to code, obviously.

I am looking for another challenging place to work. Somewhere I can actually contribute to the core tech stack, not operating from the sidelines."))}}}]);
