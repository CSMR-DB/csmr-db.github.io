          I don't do Twitter and I don't really use Facebook other than checking
          it about twice a year. However, there are other ways to get in touch
          with me. I don't have a fancy form (yet), but that shouldn't be a
          dealbreaker. I check my mail at least once a day, LinkedIn weekly and
          I'm pretty much always available on Discord. You just do whatever
          feels right ðŸ˜‰.
