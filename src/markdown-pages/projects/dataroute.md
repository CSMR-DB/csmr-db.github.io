excerpt: 'During my year 4 minor we had one major assignment: Take any form of
  data you can find on your route from home to college. I chose mobile
  network speed, took 20 points of measure, fiddled up some concepts
  and eventually landed on this very abstract piece.'

It is meant to be minimalistic and give the viewer something to think about, to make them wander "what could it mean". In earlier versions there was a trace connecting all the dots, but that felt "off". I also had a version which plotted all the measurement points on an actual route on the map, but that quickly became too cluttered and visually distracting. In the end I decided to completely strip out everything I considered not necessary and just present it as shown. The only clue given is the name, in the bottom left.
