excerpt: "In the first half of my second year there was this group project for a local students' guild centered around iceskating. We designed and I developed a Wordpress theme powered by the Customizer API."

The Customizer API was used to edit key template fields like headers, social links, theme colors and the ability to set CSS `filter:` options to images. We also included some preset plugins to the demo to showcase a few plugins that had been integrated to the template's UI styles.
