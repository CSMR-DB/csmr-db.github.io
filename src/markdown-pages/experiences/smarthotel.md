excerpt: 'I worked on a data visualization dashboard to provide the company with
  insights in their key metrics, to see how their BHAG (Big, Hairy,
  Audacious Goal) was progressing. This project was built using MeteorJS,
  React (with styled-components), D3.js, GraphQL and the database of
  choice was MongoDB. It was deployed locally on an Ubuntu Server VM and
  had a C# application to collect the data running on a Windows Server VM.
  There is nothing to show for it, since it was an internal project. No
  access from outside.'
