excerpt: "I absolutely love it. I understand TypeScript's limits but having the compile-time safety has proven to be a huge time-saver, especially when using the strictest tsconfig imagineable. Combining the power of Reflect-metadata with Decorators to create a tiny DI system is awesome. I am looking forward to potentially getting Regex types, or anything that would provide finer grained control over exact type structure."
