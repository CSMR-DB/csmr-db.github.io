title: 'MongoDB'
excerpt: "MongoDB being provided by default in MeteorJS' stack has made it the first DB engine I have worked with. Reading the JSON-like format used in Collections has made it easy to work with. I've used Mongoose as the NodeJS driver to create strongly typed schemas and to .populate() documents in a somewhat relational manner, which worked out well for that use-case."
