excerpt: "I know about and understand the purpose of version control and find it infuriating to see big (game) publishers not using it properly. But personally, I have only really used Git for personal projects. I haven't dealt with branches or any form of consistency in commits, as I've never really felt the need to. I haven't yet collaborated with anyone or had someone to code review with, so my commits tend to be big and messy. This is just for personal projects where I'm all about experimenting and refactoring constantly."
