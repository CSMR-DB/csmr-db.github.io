excerpt: 'Yes! Please, use it more. I think the developer experience of using GraphQL is absolutely amazing. Having control over WHAT you want to fetch, preventing over- / under-fetching of data is just marvellous. And you can wrap REST APIs in GraphQL, forcing the server to do the heavy lifting of dealing with over- & under-fetching of data and returning only the essential data to the client. Getting an object with 200 lines of data when I only want about 20 is NOT fun.'
