excerpt: "I love CSS and everything you can do with it nowadays without having to resort to JavaScript. Most notably, the CSS Grid, Flex and Filter specs. But also clip-path seems pretty cool. I always use some sort of preprocessor, be it Stylus or something like styled-components or Emotion for React (or whatever is available CSS-in-JS-wise. I don't like having to worry about naming things following any naming scheme like BEM). Not a big fan of using UI frameworks like Bootstrap or Material UI, as I feel it limits creativity."
