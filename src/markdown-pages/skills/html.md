excerpt: "HTML, along with CSS, is obviously used in any front-end JavaScript framework. Either plainly, or through JSX. I find HTML's default margins on elements stupidly annoying and always require some sort of a 'reset' CSS file. Also: article-header-main-aside-footer. I'm just glad I wasn't around during the whole table-layout-everything-fad."
