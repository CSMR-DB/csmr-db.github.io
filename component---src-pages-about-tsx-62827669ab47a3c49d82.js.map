I am a gamer, Netflix-fanatic,\n      Spotify-enthousiast, perfectionist and predominantly-self-taught\n      programmer. Full disclosure: I was also diagnosed with high-functioning\n      autism relatively late, at age 18. This is not a huge deal, but I've\n      decided to be completely up front with it. Mental health is a serious\n      issue worldwide, and I feel raising awareness in any way can only be\n      helpful. It poses challenges, but also makes me very detail-oriented. If\n      you are still interested in learning more about me, read along!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      My journey started a few years ago, when I was first introduced to\n      JavaScript during a college course. This course taught us the{' '}\n      <StyledA href=\"http://modernfamily.csmr.nl\" target=\"blank\">\n        (example) basics of HTML\n      </StyledA>{' '}\n      and concluded with all students making a DIY social media website from\n      scratch, using either vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. At the time I chose to\n      go the jQuery route as it allowed me to tackle trickier stuff seemingly\n      quicker. I had loads of fun and challenging moments trying to figure that\n      stuff out all by myself, even ending up helping out some other students\n      getting a better grade.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      When I look back at that project now, I shiver. Typical spaghetti code\n      from an inexperienced individual. NO \"architecture\" whatsoever. Not\n      surprising, obviously. In the following years I would get myself\n      introduced to working with React, MeteorJS and a little bit of Vue. I even\n      did some stuff with Wordpress & PHP, developing some templates for\n      projects that required a website. In all these efforts, I was on my own.\n      And every single time I realized I loved the feeling of trying to figure\n      stuff out. I learned to have a love / hate relationship with being stuck\n      with a problem because I would eventually find a solution. Whether or not\n      said solution would prove to be optimal left to be seen.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Eventually, these experienced landed me an internship at a company with an\n      amazing atmosphere. I signed up for another half year of trying to figure\n      things out myself, as I was warned that JavaScript / NodeJS / React was\n      not part of their tech stack. I was tasked with building a metrics\n      dashboard, to visualize the BHAG (Big, Hairy, Audacious Goal) as well as\n      some other metrics. I built that project using MeteorJS, as it allowed me\n      to get up & running quickly, together with React, Styled-Components and\n      GraphQL. I was also responsible for deploying this app to a local\n      environment, as well as a local MongoDB instance. A colleague built a C#\n      metrics collector app, to get me the data I needed. Overall, I had an\n      amazing time there. I got to learn a bit about Test Driven Development and\n      the SOLID paradigm and have been improving on those fronts ever since.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Anything else?</h2>\n    <p>\n      During college I also got to learn the basics of marketing and graphic\n      design. I enjoyed working with Illustrator, After Effects, InDesign and\n      even a bit of Cinema4D, and I'd consider myself adequate on these fronts.\n      What this means, however, is that I am able to communicate and collaborate\n      with all these \"different people\". I am also a perfectionist and there is\n      not a day that goes by where I don't find something that frustrates me. I\n      absolutely LOVE good UX, and I hate seeing what could be considered\n      \"minor\" flaws in design. The same applies to code, obviously. But I don't\n      see myself in a position to really critique developers. I am aware that\n      there is a lot for me to improve on.\n    </p>\n    <h2>And now?</h2>\n    <p>\n      A year later I discontinued my college as I found that, at that point, I\n      lacked motivation to continue. I found my passion in programming and\n      college wasn't going to help me get ahead. I had already outgrown the\n      level required in my first two years and I want to find out how far I can\n      take it. I am looking for another challenging place to work. Somewhere I\n      can actually contribute to the core tech stack, not operating from the\n      sidelines.\n    </p>\n    <h2>PS:</h2>\n    <p>\n      I also like <StyledLink to=\"/photography\">photography</StyledLink>. I\n      don't take many shots, but it's still something I enjoy from time to time.\n    </p>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default AboutMe\n","import styled from 'styled-components'\nimport { Link } from 'gatsby'\nimport { ColorProperty } from 'csstype'\n\ninterface IStyledLinkProps {\n  color?: ColorProperty\n}\n\nexport const StyledLink = styled(Link)`\n  text-decoration: none;\n  color: ${(props: IStyledLinkProps) => props.color || 'rebeccapurple'};\n`\n\nexport const StyledA = styled.a`\n  text-decoration: none;\n  color: ${(props: IStyledLinkProps) => props.color || 'rebeccapurple'};\n`\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
