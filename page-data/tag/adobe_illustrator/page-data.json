In earlier versions there was a trace connecting all the dots, but that felt \"off\". I also had a version which plotted all the measurement points on an actual route on the map, but that quickly became too cluttered and visually distracting. In the end I decided to completely strip out everything I considered not necessary and just present it as shown.

Soon enough, I found I needed more of a challenge. I wanted to do something in 3D. Through After Effects I found out about Cinema4D, and boy was it fun. I made the scenery in 3D and played around with lighting and camera tracks. The character in the video was animated in 2D, to give something of an \"odd\" feeling when watching it. I liked the style of side-scrolling games, and wanted to try to mimic that effect.","featuredImage":null,"featuredVideo":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbANrSn5ZB0","date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Adobe Illustrator","Adobe After Effects","Cinema4D"]},"wordCount":{"words":null,"sentences":null,"paragraphs":null},"timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"","id":"d8f3c033-be18-54db-8207-344d7bf85993","html":""}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/projects/vumc","title":"VUMC Video Project","excerpt":"At the end of the year 4 minor there was this big assignment: make a datavisualization for a client according to their needs & requirements.

Make sure to get our message \"we need to come together to find a solution\" across. We created concepts, sketches and discussed ideas about doing a voice-over. We made a version using a voice-over, but were asked to make a version with subtitles instead.
