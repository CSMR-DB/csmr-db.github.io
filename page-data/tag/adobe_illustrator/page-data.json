The goal was to take some event you would consider going to, and make some sort of a promotional banner. I chose to use Lindsey Stirling, who was planned to perform at 013 Tilburg, and made a poster with Layar data displayed on it in an \"L\"-shape (L for Lindsey). It had a video of her performing Radioactive, a ticket purchase link and, if I recall correctly, a link to her website.
