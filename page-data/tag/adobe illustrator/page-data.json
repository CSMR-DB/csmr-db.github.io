Soon enough, I found I needed more of a challenge. I wanted to do something in 3D. Through After Effects I found out about Cinema4D, and boy was it fun. I made the scenery in 3D and played around with lighting and camera tracks. The character in the video was animated in 2D, to give something of an \"odd\" feeling when watching it. I liked the style of side-scrolling games, and wanted to try to mimic that effect.","featuredImage":null,"featuredVideo":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbANrSn5ZB0","date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Adobe Illustrator","Adobe After Effects","Cinema4D"]},"wordCount":{"words":2,"sentences":1,"paragraphs":1},"timeToRead":1,"excerpt":"More text :)","id":"d8f3c033-be18-54db-8207-344d7bf85993","html":"<p>More text :)</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/projects/vumc","title":"VUMC Video Project","excerpt":"At the end of the year 4 minor there was this big assignment: make a datavisualization for a client according to their needs & requirements.

Make sure to get our message \"we need to come together to find a solution\" across. We created concepts, sketches and discussed ideas about doing a voice-over. We made a version using a voice-over, but were asked to make a version with subtitles instead. I took it upon myself to create the entire animation in After Effects and find a suiting (&#x26; free) piece of background music. The end result: a composition with consistency at the center, and smooth transitions to highlight important sections.</p>\n<p>More text :)</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"tag":"Adobe Illustrator"}}}
