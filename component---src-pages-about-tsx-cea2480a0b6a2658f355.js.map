My first language is Dutch, but I often\n        prefer using English (and actually understand the difference between\n        there, their and they're). What is there to tell about myself? I am a\n        gamer, Netflix-fanatic, Spotify-enthousiast, perfectionist and\n        predominantly-self-taught programmer. If you are interested in learning\n        more about me, read along!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        My journey started a few years ago, when I was first introduced to\n        JavaScript during a college course. This course taught us the{' '}\n        <StyledA href=\"http://modernfamily.csmr.nl\" target=\"blank\">\n          (example) basics of HTML\n        </StyledA>{' '}\n        and concluded with all students making a DIY social media website from\n        scratch, using either vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. At the time I chose\n        to go the jQuery route as it allowed me to tackle trickier stuff\n        seemingly quicker. I had loads of fun and challenging moments trying to\n        figure that stuff out all by myself, even ending up helping out some\n        other students getting a better grade.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        When I look back at that project now, I shiver. Typical spaghetti code\n        from an inexperienced individual. NO \"architecture\" whatsoever. Not\n        surprising, obviously. In the following years I would get myself\n        introduced to working with React, MeteorJS and a little bit of Vue. I\n        even did some stuff with Wordpress & PHP, developing some templates for\n        projects that required a website. In all these efforts, I was on my own.\n        And every single time I realized I loved the feeling of trying to figure\n        stuff out. I learned to have a love / hate relationship with being stuck\n        with a problem because I would eventually find a solution. Whether or\n        not said solution would prove to be optimal left to be seen.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Eventually, these experienced landed me an internship at a company with\n        an amazing atmosphere. I signed up for another half year of trying to\n        figure things out myself, as I was warned that JavaScript / NodeJS /\n        React was not part of their tech stack. I was tasked with building a\n        metrics dashboard, to visualize the BHAG (Big, Hairy, Audacious Goal) as\n        well as some other metrics. I built that project using MeteorJS, as it\n        allowed me to get up & running quickly, together with React,\n        Styled-Components and GraphQL. I was also responsible for deploying this\n        app to a local environment, as well as a local MongoDB instance. A\n        colleague built a C# metrics collector app, to get me the data I needed.\n        Overall, I had an amazing time there. I got to learn a bit about Test\n        Driven Development and the SOLID paradigm and have been improving on\n        those fronts ever since.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Anything else?</h2>\n      <p>\n        During college I also got to learn the basics of marketing and graphic\n        design. I enjoyed working with Illustrator, After Effects, InDesign and\n        even a bit of Cinema4D, and I'd consider myself adequate on these\n        fronts. What this means, however, is that I am able to communicate and\n        collaborate with all these \"different people\". I am also a perfectionist\n        and there is not a day that goes by where I don't find something that\n        frustrates me. I absolutely LOVE good UX, and I hate seeing what could\n        be considered \"minor\" flaws in design. The same applies to code,\n        obviously. And I'm learning more each and every day to improve myself on\n        that front.\n      </p>\n      <h2>And now?</h2>\n      <p>\n        A year later I discontinued my college as I found that, at that point, I\n        lacked motivation to continue. I found my passion in programming and\n        college wasn't going to help me get ahead. I had already outgrown the\n        level required in my first two years and I want to find out how far I\n        can take it. I am looking for another challenging place to work.\n        Somewhere I can actually contribute to the core tech stack, not\n        operating from the sidelines.\n      </p>\n      <h2>PS:</h2>\n      <p>\n        I also like <StyledLink to=\"/photography\">photography</StyledLink>. I\n        don't take many shots, but it's still something I enjoy from time to\n        time.\n      </p>\n    </CenteredBlock>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\n// tslint:disable-next-line: no-default-export\nexport default AboutMe\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
